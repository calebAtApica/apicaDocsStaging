| Term                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| **Project**                   | A project is a container for **one to many** **test instances**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Test Instance**             | A test instance is a container for **one to many Load Test Results**. When you configure a Load Test, you will assign it to an instance, where it will be stored when the test is completed                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Test** or **Load Test**     | A single load test. The primary purpose of using ALT is to create and run load tests using a combination of scripts and supporting settings, which are defined when completing the [Create New Loadtest wizard](broken-reference)                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Job**                       | In the context of the ALT Portal, a job is a running or completed Load Test or Scenario. Running and completed jobs can be viewed from the Loadtest > Jobs page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Script**                    | The component of the load test which defines the user journey, even if that user journey is a single URL call. Scripts can be created from individual URL calls, from a Selenium script, or from a [ZebraTester](https://apica-kb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DAZT/overview#!spacehome) script. ZebraTester scripts are most commonly utilized for use in Load Tests or Scenarios                                     |
| **Scenario**                  | A collection of load tests which are grouped together and executed concurrently using common configuration settings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Preset**                    | <p>A collection of settings which is applied when creating a load test. Aids in the creation of load tests when a user wishes to apply a set of common settings to several different load tests, but run them separately and not as a Scenario. Presets are specified when creating a Load Test via the <a href="https://api-alt-us1.apicasystems.com/v1/Help/Route/POST-selfservicejobs-preset">API</a></p><p></p> |
| **Performance Monitor Agent** | The Performance Monitoring Agent is a service that collects performance metrics at regular intervals. The collected data is sent to a controller server which stores the data in a database administered by Apica. Examples of metrics collected by the agent include CPU usage, memory usage, network, and disk utilization                                                                                        |
| **Executing Agent**           | A Linux or Windows machine which is responsible for running some or all of a Load Test or Scenario. The machine must have [ZebraTester installed](https://apica-kb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DAZT/pages/4620882/Install+ZebraTester) on it in order to execute load tests                                                                                                                                           |
