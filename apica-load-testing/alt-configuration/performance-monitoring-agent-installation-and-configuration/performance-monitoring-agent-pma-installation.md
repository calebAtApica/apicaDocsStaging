# Performance Monitoring Agent (PMA) Installation

The Apica Monitoring Agent is a service that collects performance metrics at regular intervals. The collected data is sent to a controller server which stores the data in a database administered by Apica. Examples of metrics collected by the agent include CPU usage, memory usage, network, and disk utilization. The PMA agent communicates with its controller via TCP or HTTP. Utilize the following table to determine which hostname:port combination to whitelist in order to connect the agent to the controller server.

| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| host      | Do not change! The hostname or IP address of the agent controller. This will be provided by the Apica team.                          |
| ticket    | Unique identifier for this agent. This will be provided by the Apica team.                                                           |
| pmcConfig | The filename of the pmcConfig file, located in the installation directory of the agent. Default value = pmcconfig.xml.               |
| protocol  | The protocol used by the agent to communicate with the agent controller. Accepted values are TCP or HTTP. The default value is TCP.  |
| protocol  |  The protocol used by the agent to communicate with the agent controller. Accepted values are TCP or HTTP. The default value is TCP. |

#### Configure performance counters

The pmcConfig file describes the performance counters that will be collected by the agent.

In this example we instruct the agent to collect the performance counter % Processor Time in performance object Processor, and we want to collect statistics for all processors so we set the instance to \_Total.

```
<performanceCounter>
  <pmc name="cid">1</pmc>
  <pmc name="CategoryName">Processor</pmc>
  <pmc name="CounterName">% Processor Time</pmc>
  <pmc name="InstanceName">_Total</pmc>
</performanceCounter>
```

The easiest way to find additional Performance Counters is to open perfmon.exe on the local machine and add a new counter.

You will be presented with a list of Categories like Processor or Processor Information and within these categories, you will find different performance counters like % User Time or % Processor Time.

Once you have added the counter to perfmon, the selected counters will be displayed at the bottom of the window. The list of selected counters contains the information that needs to be supplied to the agent in the pmcConfig file.

```
Object = CategoryName, Counter = CounterName, Instance = InstanceName
```

You can find a complete list of pre-defined counters as well as instructions for creating your own counters in the following article: [https://apica-kb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ALTDOCS/pages/878182402](https://apica-kb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ALTDOCS/pages/878182402)

You can find several templates which include sets of pre-defined counters tailored to different environments (SQL server, for example) in this article: [https://apica-kb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ALTDOCS/pages/5672726](https://apica-kb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ALTDOCS/pages/5672726)

## Troubleshooting Windows Agents

Troubleshooting the agent installation or operation can be done by referencing the error messages in logs.

**Examples**

Logs: The agent logs are sent to the application event log in windows.

Connectivity issues

If the agent is configured to use plain TCP it must be able to connect to ltagcontroller.apicasystem.com on TCP port 26300.

If the agent is configured to use HTTP is must be able to connect to ltagcontroller.apicasystem.com on TCP port 26301.

Misconfigured Performance Counters

The error message below occurs when the agent is unable to fetch a performance counter from the underlying operating system. Please check your pmcConfig file and correct any errors, also make sure that you are able to find all of the configured performance counters using perfmon.exe on the local machine.

## Linux Troubleshooting

Troubleshooting the agent installation or operation can be done by referencing the error messages in logs.

### Examples

Logs: The agent logs are sent to the application event log in windows.

**Connectivity issues**

Connectivity issues: If the agent is configured to use plain TCP it must be able to connect to ltagcontroller.apicasystem.com on TCP port 26300. If the agent is configured to use HTTP is must be able to connect to ltagcontroller.apicasystem.com on TCP port 26301.

**Note:** If you are using an internal agent controller, please make sure that the agent is able to connect to the internal host name or IP address on either 26300 (TCP) or 26301 (HTTP).

**Custom metrics**

The Linux client supports custom metrics gathered from an external script. The script must send output to standard output in the following format (one JSON object per value):

{ \`counter\_id\` : { \`id\` : counter\_id, \`timestamp\` : unix\_timestamp, \`value\` : sample\_value }, \`counter\_id\` : { \`id\` : counter\_id, \`timestamp\` : unix\_timestamp, \`value\` : sample\_value } }

| Item            | Description                                         |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| counter\_id     | Counter identifier, configured in agent controller. |
| unix\_timestamp | Unix timestamp (seconds since 1970-01-01)           |
| sample\_value   | Numeric (Integer) value                             |

In the configuration file you need to uncomment and edit the following settings (The example below uses a python script but you may use any kind of script that prints to stdout):

script\_enabled = true

script = python path/to/your/python/script

**Example: Established connections**

\#!/usr/bin/python import os import time cons = os.popen("netstat -nt | grep ESTABLISHED | wc -l").read(); print { "28" : { "id" : 28, "timestamp" : int(time.time()), "value" : int(cons.replace('\n',''))} };

**Example: Threads**

\#!/usr/bin/python import os import time threads = os.popen("ps -eLF | wc -l").read(); print { "42" : { "id" : 42, "timestamp" : int(time.time()), "value" : int(threads.replace('\n','')

**Misconfigured Performance Counters**

The error message below occurs when the agent is unable to fetch a performance counter from the underlying operating system. Please check your pmcConfig file and correct any errors, also make sure that you are able to find all of the configured performance counters using perfmon.exe on the local machine.
